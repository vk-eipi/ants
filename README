Versions of the bot starting from NumDiff requires the NumPy library to be installed in order to run.
Code only tested in Linux.

My work on the Fall 2011 AI Challenge, Ants, uses the default Python starter package as a base to work from. I used ideas from the Forums such as collaborative diffusion and Memetix's combat logic.
